# WeatherXM-Home-Assistant
Extract weather data from any weatherXM station via api calls in Home Assistant.

![Alt text](imgs/ha-img1.png "link")

# This implementation will create the following sensors:
* weather condition (sunny, cloudy, partly cloudy, rainy).
* temperature
* temperature real feel
* humidity
* wind speed
* wind gust
* pressure hpa
* wind direction
* wind direction cardinal
* live precipitation
* daily precipitation
* past 7 days precipitation
* uv_index
* icon 
* icon color

# How it works?
* navigate to [WeatheXM Explorer](https://explorer.weatherxm.com/).
* pick the station you want.
* in the website url copy the highlighted text after the # (in yellow).

![Alt text](imgs/link.png "link")

* replace the (*****) with the text you copied.

  `https://api.weatherxm.com/api/v1/cells/*****/devices`

  we need this url for the api call.
* now paste the folowing [code](sensors.yaml) to your **sensors.yaml** and replace the url in line 3 with yours.
  
  (If you don't already have **sensos.yaml** file, then create it in the `/config/` directory using your File editor.
* make sure you add this line to your configuration.yaml:

  `sensor: !include sensors.yaml`
* if the station you want is the second one in the HEX, then change the [0] with [1] in line 6.
* restart Home assistant and you're done, now weather station data is avalible in your home assistant and you're free to use it.

# Enjoy
